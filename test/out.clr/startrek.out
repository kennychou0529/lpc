Orders:  Stardate 3135

As commander of the United Starship Enterprise,
your mission is to rid the galaxy of the deadly
Klingon menace.  To do this, you must destroy the 
Klingon invasion force of 27 battle cruisers.
You have 27 solar years to complete
your mission (i.e. until stardate 3161).  The 
Enterprise is currently in quadrant 6-3, sector 2-4.

Do you need further instructions (y/n) ? 

The galaxy is divided into 64 quadrants with the
following coordinates:

  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  0

Each quadrant is similarly divided into 64 sectors.

 Course = a number in degrees.
   Numbers indicate direction starting at the top and
   going counter clockwise.

 Warp Factor = a REAL number from 0 to 12.
   Distance traveled = <warp factor> quadrants.
     Warp  .2  =  The Enterprise travels 1 sector.
           .5  =                         4 sectors.
            1  =                         1 quadrant.
            2  =                         2 quadrants.

   For example, if you travel from quadrant 1-1 in the
   direction of 90 degrees at warp 2, you would stop at
   quadrant 1-3 in the next stardate.  NOTE: every use of
   the warp engines takes one stardate.  If the Enterprise
   is blocked by something during an intra-quadrant travel,
   it will stop in front of it (and waste a stardate).

 :: Short Range Sensors ::

  The short range sensors display a detailed view of the 
  quadrant currently occupied by the Enterprise.  The 
  The following symbols have meanings as follows:

          Symbol          Meaning
             .            empty space

             @            a Klingon base

 :: Long Range Sensors ::

  The long range sensors display the objects in the nine
  closest quadrants.  Each digit in each box means 
  means something:

    The ONES digit represents the number of STARS.
        TENS                                FEDERATION BASES.
        HUNDREDS                            KLINGON SHIPS
        THOUSANDS                           KLINGON BASES

  For example:
    319 means 3 Klingons, 1 Federation base, and 9 stars.
    206 means 2 Klingons, 0 Federation bases, and 6 stars.
   1007 means 1 Klingon base and 7 stars.

 :: Phasers ::

  Any portion of the energy available can be fired.  The
  battle computer divides this amount among the Klingon
  ships in the quadrant and determines the various directions

  of fire.  The effectiveness of a hit depends mostly on the
  distance to the target.  A Klingon battle cruiser starts with
  300 units of energy.  It can fire an amount equal to
  whatever energy is left.  Note that phasers are ineffective 
  against stars, Klingon bases, and Federation bases.

 :: Photon Torpedoes ::

  Initially the Enterprise has 10 photon torpedoes.
  One torpedo destroys whatever it hits.  The range of the
  photon torpedoes (like phasers) is limited to the current
  quadrant.  The course of a photon torpedo is set the same
  way as that of the Enterprise.  Torpedoes and phasers are
  restocked when the Enterprise docks at a Federation base.

 :: Damage Control Report ::

  The damage control report lists the state of repair of each
  device.  A non-zero state indicates the number of stardates
  required to repair the device.  Devices can be damaged by
  space storms, and are repaired by time and truces.

 :: History Computers ::

  The history computers keep a record of all the quadrants
  scanned with the long range scanners.  The history report
  uses the same display format as the long range scanners,
  except that the entire galaxy is displayed.  A quadrant
  that has not been scanned is printed as "+++++".

 :: Suicide Device ::

  It is possible to implement a self-destruct sequence merely
  by invoking this command.  The game is terminated.

To get a list of all commands, type "9" when asked for a
command.  All commands are terminated by the [RETURN] key.
You have at least on supporting starbase.  Your energy and
photon torpedoes are replenished when you are docked at a
Federation starbase.  G O O D   L U C K !
